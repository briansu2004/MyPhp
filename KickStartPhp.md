# Kickstart Php

## Kickstart a full stack web app with Php Mysql and Laravel

1. **Setup Environment:**
   - Install PHP, MySQL, Composer (dependency manager for PHP), and Laravel globally.
   - We can use tools like XAMPP, WAMP, or Laravel Valet to quickly set up our development environment.

2. **Create a New Laravel Project:**
   - Open the terminal and navigate to the directory where we want to create our project.
   - Run the following command to create a new Laravel project:

     ```dos
     composer create-project --prefer-dist laravel/laravel our-awesome-project
     ```

3. **Database Configuration:**
   - Configure our MySQL database credentials in the `.env` file located in the root directory of our Laravel project.
   - Modify the `DB_CONNECTION`, `DB_HOST`, `DB_PORT`, `DB_DATABASE`, `DB_USERNAME`, and `DB_PASSWORD` according to our MySQL setup.

4. **Create Models, Views, and Controllers:**
   - Laravel follows the MVC (Model-View-Controller) architecture.
   - Create models to interact with our database tables using Laravel's Eloquent ORM.
   - Create controllers to handle user requests and business logic.
   - Create views to render HTML pages.

5. **Routing:**
   - Define routes in `routes/web.php` to map HTTP requests to controller methods.

6. **Frontend Development:**
   - Laravel comes with Laravel Mix, which is a wrapper around Webpack, simplifying the process of working with frontend assets.
   - We can use Blade templating engine to build dynamic views.
   - Optionally, We can integrate frontend frameworks like Vue.js or React.js with Laravel.

7. **Authentication and Authorization:**
   - Laravel provides built-in authentication and authorization functionalities.
   - Use `php artisan make:auth` command to scaffold basic authentication views and routes.

8. **Validation and Form Handling:**
   - Laravel offers robust form validation mechanisms.
   - Utilize Laravel's validation methods in our controllers to validate user input.

9. **Testing:**
   - Write tests using PHPUnit, Laravel's testing framework, to ensure the reliability of our application.
   - Laravel provides convenient helpers for testing HTTP requests, database interactions, etc.

10. **Deployment:**
    - Once our application is ready, deploy it to a web server.
    - Services like Laravel Forge, Laravel Vapor, or traditional hosting providers can be used for deployment.
